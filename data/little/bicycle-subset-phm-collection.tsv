163573	Olympic 'Superbike'	98/54/1	"Bicycle, Olympic 'Superbike', carbon fibre / metal, Australian Institute of Sport / Royal Melbourne Institute of Technolgoy / Bike Technologies, Australia, 1997 The ""Superbike"" bicycle comprises a special frame designed and made in Australia. The remaining components, disc wheels, cranks, pedals, seat, chain, etc, were made by Campagnolo, of Vicenza, Italy; this company is a sponsor of the Olympic cycling team. The mass of the bike is 5 kg. The conventional tubular frame has been replaced by a composite monocoque shell made of carbon fibre which is scientifically shaped to reduce aerodynamic drag. The conventional handle bars have been eliminated, and instead carbon fibre handlegrips are attached directly to the wheelforks. This feature provides extra strength between the seat and pedals, where the rider's power is exerted. The sweeping aerodynamic lines of the Superbike combine with the lightweight carbon fibre shell to enable the bike to travel at a given speed with the exertion of five percent less power when compared to a conventional tubular framed racing bike. The use of the carbon fibre construction enables any shape to be formed with maximum strength and minimum amount of material. This is why carbon fibre is used so widely in the space programmes and Formula One motor racing. Unlike most equipment used by elite athletes, the Superbike has been designed for low cost, high volume manufacture."

A ""Kangaroo-style"" geared-up chain drive is fitted to the larger front driving wheel. The cranks, each with a short chain, are fitted below the wheel hub. The bicycle has a tubular frame, radial, steel spokes and solid rubber tyres. It is believed that this bicycle was made by Cooper, Kitchen & Co., of Yorkshire because of the unique round front fork arrangement with double-sided open head. The dropped handle bars have wooden handgrips. A lever and spoon brake on the front wheel operates by pulling a lever on the right handle-bar. It is considered that this is not an original one. The rider's seat, an Arab cradle spring saddle by Brooks, is also not original. Other fittings include footrests on the front forks for resting the legs when travelling down hill and a rear step for mounting which is an unusual triangular shape down to the hub of the rear wheel. This is possibly a later addition. The bicycle is finished in black. -1 Bicycle -X MAAS stand (Shares stand with B1259)"	"Number on crank: ""17671"" Rear solid rubber tyre: ""John Bull North Pole Patent [1 x 4]."

249216	American Star bicycle, 1885-1890	H7805	Bicycle, American Star, metal / leather, made by H. P. Smith Machine Co., Smithville, Burlington County, New Jersey, USA, 1885-1890, designed by George W. Pressey, Hammonton, New Jersey, USA, 1881 The American Star bicycle reversed the penny farthing arrangement and has the small wheel, 22 inches (56 cm) in diameter, at the front, which was for steering, and the large wheel, 50 inches (127 cm), at the rear. Both wheels have steel radial butted spokes and solid rubber tyres. The bicycle is operated by levers and ratchet gear from the rear wheel. The levers carry the pedals on the forward ends and are hinged at the rear to projections on the lower rod of the frame behind the hub. At the bend of the levers, below the hub, leather straps are attached to pins. The straps, which are not original, pass around drums on the driving wheel axles. Pressure on the levers draw down the straps and rotate the drums which drive the wheel through a ratchet arrangement. A spring within the drum wound up the strap and raised the lever to make it ready for the next stroke. The levers could be depressed alternately or, when increased speed was required, simultaneously. The leather straps are missing the metal clip arrangement for tying on to levers. There is a spoon brake operating on the rear wheel. The bicycle has broken spokes and shows traces of green paint with white lining. There are a number of missing parts including the handlebars, saddle pan, saddle and rubber read on pedal.

240501	H4692 Bicycle, Velocipede, boneshaker, Michaux-type, metal c. 1869	H4692	Bicycle, Velocipede, boneshaker, Michaux-type, metal c. 1869 The bicycle comprises a wrought-iron frame, with iron-tyred wheels which have wooden non-dished radial spokes forming a single row on the front wheel and a double row of alternating spokes at the back. The wheels may have been replaced. The cranks and pedals are not original and are recent additions from the early 20th century. The Michaux-type Velocipede, of which this bicycle is an example, combines the round backbone and rear forks in the one forging, running diagonally from the front socket to the rear axle. The saddle, comprising a padded leatherette cover over an iron alloy base, is bolted to the long, single, leaf spring backbone of the bicycle by a pair of curved stays from the rear axle. A lever shoe brake acts on the rear wheel and is operated by rotating the polished wooden hand grips on the handlebars which turn the central bar. This activates the brake by tightening a length of metal wire, which is thought to have replaced the original chain, which runs from the centre of the bar, under the frame to the rear wheel. There are curved leg rests projecting over the front wheel for raising the feet from the fast revolving pedals while coasting downhill. The bicycle is finished in black/brown paint, the timber wheels are stained dark brown. -1 Bicycle -X MAAS for storage, shares with B728					Bicycles|Transport-Land	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=240501						"This text content licensed under<a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/"" rel=""license"" about=""http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=240501#_cc-by-sa_content"">CC BY-SA</a>."

With the dwarf style, the front wheel is not as large as the ordinary bicycle, the saddle is placed further back than the ordinary and the pedals are lowered by pivoting them on the ends of levers which are mounted below the front wheel hub. These levers pivot at the front ends to lower the extensions of the front forks. The mid points are connected to cranks by short articulated links. The foot action follows an oval instead of a circle. The bicycle is fitted with a spoon brake which is activated by a twist grip lever on the right grip of the handlebar and works on the front wheel. The straight handle bars are fitted with pear-shaped horn hand grips. There is also a trouser guard but no saddle is fitted. -1 Bicycle -X MAAS stand (shares with B1265)					Bicycles|Transport-Land	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=207249	1040 mm	610 mm				"This text content licensed under<a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/"" rel=""license"" about=""http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=207249#_cc-by-sa_content"">CC BY-SA</a>."

The seat tube is curved and crosses the main tube, which joins the steering head to the rear forks, at right angles to provide extra strength. This gave the cross-frame frame design its name. An unusual system of stays helps to strengthen the bicycle. A small stay braces the seat tube immediately below the seat, a pair run down to the base of the seat tube while another pair extend to the back forks. The bicycle also features a plunger style brake lever on the handle bars with a spoon acting on the front wheels, two front forks with a footrest for going downhill, mudguards on both wheels, and a sprung leather saddle. It also has Rudge style bearings on the rear wheel. The wheels have weldless steel rims with 'Rapid true' tangent spokes. The bicycle is missing a handlebar grip.

The frame is steel tubing with forks for the rear wheel with nickel-plated steel rim with spokes and pedals of white rubber. Thirteen missing spokes were replaced by the Museum in 1980. Some of the existing spokes appear to have been replaced earlier and are not the original ones. The bicycle is driven from the front wheel. The hub is connected by two chains, one each side of the front wheel, to a lower set of cogged wheels to which the pedals are attached. There are two small holes above the front wheel bearings, these are for foot supports so that riders could lift their feet off the pedals when travelling downhill. In many respects the bicycle resembles an ordinary or penny farthing bicycle, with the same type of tubular frame, solid rubber white-coloured tyres and a rear mounting step. The bicycle was originally painted black with nickel-plated hubs, bearings, cranks and various fastenings. There is evidence of green paint on the pedals but on no other parts. Missing parts include the seat, chain guards, foot rests, handle bars, brake assembly and front wheel bearing race and balls.
